  I have picked the Autonomous navigation of mars rover project as one of my preferences for the summer projects because I am passionate about various tools used in it like object-oriented programming, and want to grow further and expand my knowledge related to various python libraries and the kind of work that can be done using it.
  I also expect to increase my skills and simultaneously also contribute to the club for the project and hope that I will be able to achieve growth with utmost sincerity.
